## Movie app - BigCinema

BigCinema is a React-based movie search application that provides users with an intuitive and seamless experience for discovering movies. The app fetches data from the OMDB API, allowing users to search for movies by title and view detailed information, including posters, release dates, and summaries. It utilizes React hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage state efficiently and dynamically update the UI based on user interactions.

To enhance the user experience, BigCinema implements infinite scrolling, allowing users to browse a vast collection of movies without pagination interruptions. The app is styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a modern and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. React Router is integrated to enable smooth navigation between pages, including a dedicated Favorites page.

One of the standout features of BigCinema is its ability to let users save their favorite movies. When a user selects a movie as a favorite, it gets stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that their selections persist even after refreshing the page. The Favorites page retrieves and displays these saved movies, making it easy for users to revisit them anytime.

Overall, BigCinema is a feature-rich movie app designed for convenience, speed, and user engagement.
